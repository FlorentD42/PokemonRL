# Pokemon x Rogue-Like (working title)

## Description
PxRL is a Javascript based game trying to mix the gameplay of Pokémon with that of Rogue-Like games (WIP). The base idea (still subject to changes) is to appear in a randomly-generated world, choose a starter, explore, battle trainers, catch wild Pokémon, win all 4 gym badges and finally beat the league. 

A live demo is available [here](http://shugah.net).

## TODO List
- [x] Outdoor map generation and exploration (done before the Git upload)
- [ ] Houses and cave systems
- [ ] NPCs (idle)
- [ ] Dialog windows (for signs, items and NPCs)
- [ ] Menu (Pokédex, Pokémon, Bag, Map)
- [ ] Items to pick up
- [ ] A combat system (simplified from the original games)
- [ ] Pokémon progression system (how they become stronger? Evolve? Learn new moves?)
- [ ] Pokémon Centers and Poké Marts
- [ ] Wild Pokémon battles
- [ ] Trainer battles
- [ ] Gym battles
- [ ] League
